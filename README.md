# How do members differ from casual user?

This work is based on a Cyclistic Bike-share company (fictitious) who has two kinds of subscribers, annual subscribers referred to as "members" and the others are "casual" subscribers/riders.

The company is more profitable when it has more members than casual riders and therefore it plans to run a campaign aimed at converting casual riders to members.

In order to use the accurate strategy in its campaign, the director sets a business task to find out how members are different from casual riders.

Therefore, this repository seeks to clean the data and provide answer to the business task.

i hope you find this interesting...
