# cyclistic-bike-share
I am Esther Anthony, a graduate of Economics and a Data Analyst.
I always love the idea of turning numbers into ideas, pictures that helps people solve problems. This is my first project after completing my Google Data Analytics Certificate Programme.

This work is based on a Cyclistic Bike-share company (fictitious) who has two kinds of subscribers, annual subscribers referred to as "members" and the others are "casual" subscribers/riders.

The company is more profitable when it has more members than casual riders and therefore it plans to run a campaign aimed at converting casual riders to members.

Inother to use the accurate strategy in its campaign, the director sets a business task to find out how members are different from casual riders.

Therefore, this repository seeks to provide answer to the business task and also recommend useful strategies that should be engaged.

i hope you find this interesting...
